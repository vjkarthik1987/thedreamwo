    "Onboarding": ["Onboarding", "Onboarding is like the 'First Date'. Make the right impression, and the chances of a long and happy relationship are high. Screw it up.

    "Goal Setting": ["Goal Setting", "You cannot score a goal, unless you mark out the goal posts.

    "Rewards and Compensation": ["Rewards and Compensation", "Salary is not a reward. It is part of an agreement between the organiation and the employee. Rewards is much more.

It is about mastery and expertise and recognition than just a change in title."],
    
    "Learning and Growth": ["Learning and Growth", "Learning in its traditional sense was about courses and trainings.

    "Flexibility": ["Flexibility", "The concept of flexibility before pandemic was more about the ability to take an hour off or about the freedom to take a day off and work from home.
